# bwsample-js
Javascript implementation of bwsample to run in a browser.

## Notes
- Variable and function names do not comply with JS conventions (e.g. camel case). We kept the same variable and function names as in the Python package [bwsample](https://pypi.org/project/bwsample/).

### Syntax
We are using 
- `snake_case`: variable names 
- `kebab-case`: JSON keys
- `camelCase`: function names, class names
